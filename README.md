# **2048 Game clone**

A simple and fun game to leave stress and other commitments behind for a couple of minutes. Because of its simplicity, it is a perfect logic game from younger to elder people. Its goal to pull tiles with the same value on each other to double them and reach 2048.

## UX design

The design primarily focus on simplicity, usability responsiveness to provide good user experience to young and old people using wide range of devices.

The goal was to be able to play on touch-enabled devices with a single touch and swipe and on other devices using mouse or keyboard.

### Initial design wire-frames / mock-ups:

- [Strategy Plane](assets/documentation/strategyPlane.pdf)
- [Importance to Viability assessment](assets/documentation/ImportancetoViability.pdf)
- [Scope Plane](assets/documentation/ScopePlane.pdf)
- [Structure Plane](assets/documentation/StructurePlane.pdf)
- [Skeleton Plane for mobile](assets/documentation/SkeletonPlaneMobile.pdf)
- [Skeleton Plane for desktop](assets/documentation/SkeletonPlaneDesktop.pdf)

Had to deviate from the initial design concept of the skeleton and structure planes, as the minimal text content did not fit to all devices and the new design gives the user a better user experience. The final planes (the changed ones) are as follows:
